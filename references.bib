  abstract = {Advanced R helps you understand how R works at a fundamental level. It is designed for R programmers who want to deepen their understanding of the language, and programmers experienced in other languages who want to understand what makes R different and special. This book will teach you the foundations of R; three fundamental programming paradigms (functional, object-oriented, and metaprogramming); and powerful techniques for debugging and optimisingyour code.By reading this book, you will learn: The difference between an object and its name, and why the distinction is important The important vector data structures, how they fit together, and how you can pull them apart using subsetting The fine details of functions and environments The condition system, which powers messages, warnings, and errors The powerful functional programming paradigm, which can replace many for loops The three most important OO systems: S3, S4, and R6 The tidy eval toolkit for metaprogramming, which allows you to manipulate code and control evaluation Effective debugging techniques that you can deploy, regardless of how your code is run How to find and remove performance bottlenecks The second edition is a comprehensive update: New foundational chapters: {"}Names and values,{"} {"}Control flow,{"} and {"}Conditions{"} comprehensive coverage of object oriented programming with chapters on S3, S4, R6, and how to choose between them Much deeper coverage of metaprogramming, including the new tidy evaluation framework use of new package like rlang (http://rlang.r-lib.org), which provides a clean interface to low-level operations, and purr (http://purrr.tidyverse.org/) for functional programming Use of color in code chunks and figuresHadley Wickham is Chief Scientist at RStudio, an Adjunct Professor at Stanford University and the University of Auckland, and a member of the R Foundation. He is the lead developer of the tidyverse, a collection of R packages, including ggplot2 and dplyr, designed to support data science. He is also the author of R for Data Science (with Garrett Grolemund), R Packages, and ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis.},

The performance of this proposal is checked throughout a simulation study considering a variety of circular distributions exhibiting multimodality, peakedness and/or skewness. The plug-in rule behavior is also compared with other existing bandwidth selectors. The method is illustrated with some classical datasets. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Nonparametric density and regression estimation methods for circular data are included in the R package NPCirc. Specifically, a circular kernel density estimation procedure is provided, jointly with different alternatives for choosing the smoothing parameter. In the regression setting, nonparametric estimation for circular-linear, circular-circular and linear-circular data is also possible via the adaptation of the classical Nadaraya-Watson and local linear estimators. In order to assess the significance of the features observed in the smooth curves, both for density and regression with a circular covariate and a linear response, a SiZer technique is developed for circular data, namely CircSiZer. Some data examples are also included in the package, jointly with a routine that allows generating mixtures of different circular distributions.},
